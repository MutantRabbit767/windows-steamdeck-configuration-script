# windows-steamdeck-configuration-script
This script is pretty much a central hub for setting up windows on the SteamDeck.

## What does it do?
Heres what this script does:
- Downloads and initiates the installation process of each driver.
- Installs a debloater and configures the debloater to only remove things that won't affect the user by adding a custom configuration file.
- Installs Steam.

## Installation
You can download the zip file [here](https://github.com/MutantRabbit767/windows-steamdeck-configuration-script/releases/download/Release/steamdeckscript.zip).
